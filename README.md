Hi! I'm Mae Bernacchi, a second year at Grinnell College who is particularly interested in Math, Computer science, and the German Language.
 
 I'm currently working on MIST with the Rebelsky Research team and pretty enveloped in in that work, but I'm always down to look at interesting code.

 If you wish to reach me, send me an email at bernacch@grinnell.edu.
